\section{FX Option Price Quotations}

We consider a currency pair ccy1/ccy2 with ccy1 denoting the foreign and ccy2 the domestic currency. To fix an example
setup we choose cc1 to be EUR and ccy2 to be USD. Now consider a european option to exchange an amount $N_d$ in domestic
currecy with an amount $N_f$ in foreign currency. The strike $K$ of the option is by definition $K=N_d / N_f$. If for
example $N_d = 132mm$ USD and $N_f = 100mm$ EUR then $K = 1.32$. We consider different possible price quotations.

\subsection{Domestic pips $V_{\textnormal{d, pips}} = V_{\textnormal{d/f}}$ or ccy2 pips}

The price is expressed as the option premium in domestic currency per unit amount in foreign currency. In the Murex screen
we might see $449.4077$ USD pips which means that the premium to be paid in cash is $4,494,077$ USD (multiply the USD pips
quotation by the EUR nominal, where one has to know in addition that $1$ pip = $0.01\%$ = $0.0001$).

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_{\textnormal{d,pips}}$ or $V_{\textnormal{d/f}}$, in Murex it is ccy2 pips.

\subsection{Foreign percent $V_{\%\textnormal{f}}$ or \% ccy2}

The price is expressed as the option premium in foreign currency per unit amount in foreign currency. If $S$ is the
FX exchange rate (i.e. the value of one unit of foreign currency in domestic currency, e.g. the value of $1$ EUR in USD in
our example setting) applicable to the settlement of the premium payment, we can obviously compute this quantity as
$V_{\%\textnormal{f}} = V_{\textnormal{d,pips}} / S$. If for example $S = 1.3172$ we would expect $V_{\%\textnormal{f}} = 3.411841$ in our example above. In
Murex we would see this quantity as $3.411841$ \% EUR.

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_{\%\textnormal{f}}$, in Murex it is \% ccy1.


\subsection{Domestic percent $V_{\%\textnormal{d}}$ or \% ccy1}.

The price is expressed as the option premium in domestic currency per unit amount in domestic currency. Since
$N_d = K N_f$ we can directy express this quantity as $V_{\textnormal{d, pips}} / K$. In our example setting we get
$V_{\%\textnormal{d}} = 340.4604$ (since $K=1.32$ and $V_{\textnormal{d, pips}} = 449.4077$) which is displayed in Murex as 
$3.404604$ \% USD.

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_{\%\textnormal{d}}$, in Murex it is \% ccy2.

\subsection{Foreign pips $V_{\textnormal{f, pips}} = V_{\textnormal{f/d}}$ or ccy1 pips.}

The price is expressed as the option premium in foreign currency per unit amount in domestic currency. This can be
easily derived as $V_{\%\textnormal{d}} / S$, with above figures this yields $258.4728$ EUR pips in Murex notation.

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_{\textnormal{f, pips}}$, in Murex it is ccy1 pips.

\subsection{Absolute domestic premium $V_d$}.

The price is given as the absolute premium in domestic currency $V_d = N_f V_{d/f}$, which is $4,494,077$ USD in
the example here.

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_d$, in Murex this value can be seen in the field price amount (with the price
field set to a ccy2 currency quotation mode).

\subsection{Absolute foreign premium $V_f$}.

The price is given as the absolute premium in foreign currency $V_f = N_d V_{f/d}$, which is $3,411,841$ EUR in
our example.

The notation in \cite{Clark} is $V_f$, in Murex this value can again be seen in the field price amount (with the
price field set to a ccy1 currency quotation mode).
